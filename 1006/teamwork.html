    Tile Teamwork Tactics
    In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided die. If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.

    Can you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? Create a function that takes your position a and your friend's position b and returns a boolean representation of whether it's possible to earn a bonus on any die roll.

    Examples
    possibleBonus(3, 7) ➞ true

    possibleBonus(1, 9) ➞ false

    possibleBonus(5, 3) ➞ false
    Notes
    You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).
    If you are already on the same tile, return false, as you would be advancing away.
    Expect only positive integer inputs.

        function possibleBonus(a, b){
            const diff = b - a;

            return diff >= 1 && diff <= 6
        }
        console.log(possibleBonus(3, 7)) //true

        console.log(possibleBonus(1, 9)) //false

        console.log(possibleBonus(5, 3)) //false 
        
        console.log(possibleBonus(4, 4)) //false
